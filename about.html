            <p>Even as a student in primary education, due to my interest in video games and the desire to learn how to program them,
                I enrolled in high school, majoring in PMA, with the intention of studying at FCSE in the future. <br>
                <br>
                As a FCSE student finishing his second semester, it is more than evident that I have made the right choice for my future successful career.
                From the courses so far, my plan is to direct my career towards <span class="aboutSPAN">Game Development</span>, <span class="aboutSPAN">Web Design</span>, and being a <span class="aboutSPAN">Fullstack Developer</span>.
